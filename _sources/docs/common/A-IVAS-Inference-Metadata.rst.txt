VVAS Inference Metadata
***********************

The VVAS inference metadata (GstInferenceMeta) object holds information about the metadata produced by the machine learning (ML) inference acceleration software libraries. This metadata structure stores the inferred data generated at multiple levels of ML operation into a single structure in a hierarchical way. This data structure combines and stores metadata generated by detection and classification models.

The GStreamer plug-ins can set and get inference metadata from the GstBuffer by using the `gst_buffer_add_meta ()` API and `gst_buffer_get_meta ()` API, respectively.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GstInferenceMeta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                

GstInferenceMeta is the root node of the inference metadata. GstInferencePrediction hosts the actual inference metadata.

      typedef struct _GstInferenceMeta GstInferenceMeta;
      struct _GstInferenceMeta
      {
      GstMeta meta;

This structure represents the inference data generated from the ML operation. BBox represents the bounding box around the detected object from detection model. The classification parameter of this structure stores a list of classification information associated with the detected object. This structure also stores the results of the next level of ML operation performed (typically in cascaded network based ML operation).
