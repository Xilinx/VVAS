Custom Plug-ins
#################

Certain functions, such as video decoding, encoding, and metadata handling, require specific and complex implementations that cannot be efficiently achieved using the standard infrastructure plugins provided by GStreamer. As a result, custom GStreamer plugins are developed to provide this functionality. This section will provide more information about these custom plugins, which can be found in the ``vvas-gst-plugins`` folder within the vvas source code tree. Each custom plugin will be described in detail.
