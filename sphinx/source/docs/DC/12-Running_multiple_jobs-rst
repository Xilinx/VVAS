Introduction
**********************************

The U30 Video SDK provides two distinct methods of running multiple GStreamer jobs simultaneously on one or more devices:

#. :ref:`Using explicit device IDs <using-explicit-device-ids>` - This is the recommended method. It is the simplest to use and will work for most use cases.
#. :ref:`Using the job description and reservation service <using-job-descriptions>` - This method is considered an advanced feature. It is provided for users who need to develop custom job management services.

Both methods rely on the Xilinx® FPGA resource manager (XRM). XRM is the software which manages the hardware accelerators available in the system. XRM keeps track of total system capacity for each of the compute units such as the decoder, scaler, and encoder. XRM guarantees capacity for a given use case and prevents over-allocation. For example, each of the two devices on the Alveo U30 card, can process an aggregate load of 4K pixels at 60 frames per second. It is possible to run multiple streams if the overall throughput does not exceed the limit of 4kp60. 

The accelerators on the U30 card are abstracted as compute unit (CU) resources in XRM. XRM provides an interface to reserve, allocate and release CUs. The smallest allocation unit is a channel, which is a fraction of one CU. More details on the XRM command line tool (xrmadm) and the XRM daemon (xrmd) can be found in the :ref:`xrmadm and xrmd Commands <xrmadm-and-xrmd-commands>` section of this documentation.


.. _using-explicit-device-ids:

**********************************
Using Explicit Device IDs
**********************************
The simplest way to run multiple GStreamer jobs across all available devices is to specify the device index in GStreamer plugin property device-idx in plugins.

By default the value of device index would be -1 and job will not be launched. It is mandatory to specify the device index. When running multiple jobs, device 0 will likely run out resources rapidly and additional jobs will error out due to insufficient resources. 

##The :option:`-xlnx_hwdev` option is used to specify the device on which the job should be run. This makes it easy and straightforward to leverage the entire video acceleration capacity of your system, regardless of the number of cards and devices. In addition, this method allows running different types of jobs on the same device (i.e.: jobs with different resolutions, frame rates, etc...). 

Given that each device has a 2160p60 (4K) input and output bandwidth limit, the user is responsible for only submitting jobs which will not exceed the capacity of the specified device. The section below about `Managing Resource Utilization`_ provides information on how to estimate CU requirements and check current device load.


Examples using Explicit Device IDs
==================================

Specific examples of how to run multiple GStreamer processes using explicit device IDs can be found in the :ref:`FFmpeg Tutorials <multiple-ffmpeg-jobs-example>` included in this repository.


Managing Resource Utilization
==================================

.. rubric:: Checking System Load

To check the current loading of all the devices in your system, use the following command::

    xrmadm /opt/xilinx/xrm/test/list_cmd.json

This will generate a report in JSON format containing the load information for all the compute unit (CU) resources. The report contains a section for each device in the system. The device sections contain sub-sections for each of the CUs (decoder, scaler, lookahead, encoder) in that device. For example, the load information for the encoder on device 0 may look as follows:: 

    "device_0": {
        ...
        "cu_4": {
            "cuId         ": "4",
            "cuType       ": "IP Kernel",
            "kernelName   ": "encoder",
            "kernelAlias  ": "ENCODER_MPSOC",
            "instanceName ": "encoder_1",
            "cuName       ": "encoder:encoder_1",
            "kernelPlugin ": "/opt/xilinx/xma_plugins/libvcu-xma-enc-plg.so",
            "maxCapacity  ": "497664000",
            "numChanInuse ": "20",
            "usedLoad     ": "831472 of 1000000",
            "reservedLoad ": "0 of 1000000",
            "resrvUsedLoad": "0 of 1000000"
        },


The ``usedLoad`` value indicates how much of that resource is currently being used. The value will range from 0 (nothing running) to 1000000 (fully loaded). The ``reservedLoad`` value indicates how much of that resource is being reserved using XRM. The ``resrvUsedLoad`` value indicates how much of the reserved load is actually being used.

In the above example, the encoder is 83.14% utilized. An additional job may only be run on this device if it requires less than 17% of the encoder resources.

.. rubric:: Insufficient Resources

If there are not enough compute unit resources available on the device to support a FFmpeg job, the job will error out with a message about resource allocation failure::

    xrm_allocation: failed to allocate decoder resources from device 0
    [MPSOC HEVC decoder @ 0x562c7695b200] xrm_allocation: resource allocation failed

In this case, you can check the system load (as described in the section below) and look for a device with enough free resources, or wait until another job finishes and releases enough resources to run the desired job.


.. rubric:: Job Resource Requirements

The load of a given job can be estimated by taking the resolution of the job as a percentage of the 2160p60 (4K) maximum. For instance, a 1080p60 stream will require 25% of the resources available on a device.

In addition, it is possible to run FFmpeg with the :option:`-loglevel` option set to ``debug`` to get information about the resource requirements for a given job. The messages generated in the transcript will look as follow::

  ---decoder xrm out: dec_load=250000, plugin=/opt/xilinx/xma_plugins/libvcu-xma-dec-plg.so, device=0, cu=6, ch=0
  ---encoder xrm out: enc_load=250000, plugin=/opt/xilinx/xma_plugins/libvcu-xma-enc-plg.so, device=0, cu=38, ch=0

Resource loads are reported with a precision of 1/1000000. In the above example, the job requires 25% of the decoder resources and 25% of the encoder resources on the device.


.. _using-job-descriptions:

**********************************
Using Job Descriptions
**********************************

Job descriptions and the associated job reservation system are an alternate way to run multiple jobs. This method is more involved than using explicit device IDs, and it is intended for users who need to develop custom job management applications.

.. note::
    A current limitation of this method is that only one job description file can be used at a time, and a job description file can only contain a single job description. The system will only manage multiple jobs if they match the same description. Simultaneously managing different job types is not supported currently. The jobs need to be stopped before a new job description can be loaded.


Video Transcode Job Description
==================================

The Alveo U30 video transcode pipeline needs a conjunction of multiple CUs like decoder, scaler, lookahead, and encoder, together forming a CU pool. Based on the input resolution and type of transcode, the load of CUs within a CU pool varies. This in turn determines how many instances of such a job can be run real-time in parallel on all the cards managed by XRM. If there is free capacity, XRM will send the job to an available device.

The video transcode job description provides information to the resource manager about what kind of transcode is intended to run on the card. With this information the resource manager calculates the CU load for the specified job as well as the maximum possible number of jobs that can be run real-time in parallel.

A video transcode job description is specified through a JSON file and the key-value pairs specify the functions, formats, and resolutions needed.

function
    Which HW resource to use (DECODER, SCALER, ENCODER)

format
    Input/output format (H264, HEVC, yuv420p)

resolution
    Input/output height, width, and frame-rate as a numerator / denominator fraction 

job-count
    Optional entry to specify the number of instances of the specified job which can run on one device.
    When this entry is used, the CU load is calculated based on the specified job-count. Any channel-load value is ignored.
    This option is useful to provide an accurate number of possible jobs in the case where the load calculation by XRM is optimistic. This can happen because device memory is currently not an XRM managed resource; and in the case of high-density low-resolution jobs, it is possible to run out device memory before running out of compute resources.  

channel-load
    Optional entry to specify a different compute load for a given function than calculated by the resource manager.
    This option will be deprecated and removed in a future release. The job-count option should be used instead.

Several examples of JSON job slot descriptions can be found in the ``/opt/xilinx/launcher/scripts/describe_job`` folder once the U30 Video SDK has been installed.

Below is a modified version of the ``/opt/xilinx/launcher/scripts/describe_job/describe_job.json`` example. This JSON example describes an ABR transcode job which uses a decoder, scaler, and encoder to generate 5 output renditions. A job-count entry has been added to explicitly request 4 instances of this job per device::

    {
        "request": {
            "name": "describe_job_h264",

                            ]
                        }
                    },
                    {

                    },

                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }


The next sections document the two different ways of using job descriptions to run multiple FFmpeg processes:

- :ref:`Using the job slot reservation application <using-job-slot-reservations>`
- :ref:`The FFmpeg Launcher example <using-ffmpeg-launcher>`


.. _using-job-slot-reservations:

Using Job Slot Reservations
==================================

The job slot reservation application takes as input a video transcode job reservation in the form of a JSON file as described in the previous section. The video transcode job description provides information to the resource manager about what kind of transcode is intended to run on the card. With this information the resource manager calculates the CU load for the specified job as well as the maximum possible number of jobs that can be run real-time in parallel. 

Once the maximum possible number of jobs is known, CUs and job slots are reserved, and corresponding reservation IDs are stored in a bash file at ``/var/tmp/xilinx/xrm_jobReservation.sh``. A reservation ID is a unique identifier which is valid while the job slot reservation application is running. These reservation IDs are passed to individual FFmpeg process via an environment variable XRM_RESERVE_ID. The FFmpeg processes then use this reservation ID to retrieve the corresponding CUs reserved earlier.

The following steps show how to use the job slot reservation to dispatch multiple parallel instances of an ABR ladder job on a U30 card:

#. Setup the environment::

    source /opt/xilinx/xcdr/setup.sh

#. Run the job slot reservation application with the desired JSON job description. For example::

    jobSlotReservation /opt/xilinx/launcher/scripts/describe_job/describe_job.json

    For describe_job.json, the possible number of job slots available = 8 
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    The Job_slot_reservations are alive as long as this application is alive! 
    (press Enter to end) 
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The job slot reservation application creates a ``/var/tmp/xilinx/xrm_jobReservation.sh`` with XRM_RESERVE_ID_n set to unique IDs generated by XRM (with n ranging from 1 to the number of possible job slots for the given job). Here is an example of this generated file::

    source /opt/xilinx/xrt/setup.sh 
    source /opt/xilinx/xrm/setup.sh 
    export XRM_RESERVE_ID_1=9 
    export XRM_RESERVE_ID_2=10 
    export XRM_RESERVE_ID_3=11 
    export XRM_RESERVE_ID_4=12 
    export XRM_RESERVE_ID_5=13 
    export XRM_RESERVE_ID_6=14 
    export XRM_RESERVE_ID_7=15 
    export XRM_RESERVE_ID_8=16

#. Launch individual FFmpeg processes in distinct shells after sourcing the ``/var/tmp/xilinx/xrm_jobReservation.sh`` file and setting XRM_RESERVE_ID environment to a unique XRM_RESERVE_ID_n. 

   For job 1::

    source /var/tmp/xilinx/xrm_jobReservation.sh 
    export XRM_RESERVE_ID=${XRM_RESERVE_ID_1} 
    ffmpeg -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 ...

   For job 2::

    source /var/tmp/xilinx/xrm_jobReservation.sh 
    export XRM_RESERVE_ID=${XRM_RESERVE_ID_2} 
    ffmpeg -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 ...

   And so forth for the other jobs.

#. Press **Enter** in the job reservation app terminal to release the resources after the jobs are complete.


.. rubric:: Ill-formed JSON Job Descriptions

If you run the jobSlotReservation tool with a syntactically incorrect JSON description, you will see the following messages::

  decoder plugin function=0 fail to run the function
  scaler plugin function=0 fail to run the function
  encoder plugin function=0 fail to run the function

This indicates that the job description is ill-formed and needs to be corrected.

.. _using-ffmpeg-launcher:

The FFmpeg Launcher Example
==================================

The FFmpeg launcher is an example application which automates the dispatching of FFmpeg jobs across multiple devices. It simplifies the process of manually setting up XRM reservation IDs and launching FFmpeg for many video streams. The FFmpeg launcher takes a transcode job description, input source files, corresponding FFmpeg run commands and automatically launches child FFmpeg processes based on the job slot availability on the server. In case there are more input streams listed than available job slots, the excess are queued and launched when a job slot becomes available. Note that only a single launcher per server is supported.

.. note::
   The FFmpeg launcher is only an example application. It is provided as an illustration of how an orchestration layer can use Job Descriptions, but it is not an official feature of the U30 Video SDK.

The following steps show how to use the FFmpeg launcher for an ABR transcode use case on a single U30 card. In this use case, one encoded stream is transcoded to five unique renditions based on resolution, bit rate, and other variations.

#. Environment setup ::

    source /opt/xilinx/xcdr/setup.sh

#. To run the FFmpeg launcher, use the following command: ::

    launcher <source files file name> <run params file name>

   Here is an example of the command: ::

    launcher sources.txt /opt/xilinx/launcher/scripts/run_params/Run_ABR_h264_lowLatencyTranscode_mr_null.txt

   ``sources.txt`` is a text file that lists the input stream names. The launcher parses this list and inserts the sources in the FFmpeg command after ``-i`` one after another and launches them as a separate process. A sample ``sources.txt`` is as follows. ::

    # List all sources here 
    Input1.mp4 
    Video.flv 
    Input2.h264

   ``run_params.txt`` is a text file that consists of two fields. The first field is the video transcode job description, and the second field is the FFmpeg command line that needs to be launched and is matching the described job. Description of the job is given through a json file as described already in the previous sections. A sample ``run_params.txt`` is as follows. ::

    job_description = /opt/xilinx/launcher/scripts/describe_job/describe_job.json 
    cmdline = ffmpeg -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -i -filter_complex "multiscale_xma=:outputs=4:out_1_width=1280:out_1_height=720:out_1_pix_fm t=vcu_nv12:out_2_width=848:out_2_height=480:out_2_pix_fmt=vcu_nv12:out_3_ width=640:out_3_height=360:out_3_pix_fmt=vcu_nv12:out_4_width=288:out_4_h eight=160:out_4_pix_fmt=vcu_nv12 [a][b][c][d]; [a]split[aa][ab]" -map '[aa]' -b:v 4M -max-bitrate 4M -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f h264 -y out_720p60.264 -map '[ab]' -r 30 -b:v 3M -max-bitrate 3M -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f h264 -y out_720p30.264 -map '[b]' -r 30 -b:v 2500K - max-bitrate 2500K -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f h264 -y out_480p30.264 -map '[c]' -r 30 -b:v 1250K -max-bitrate 1250K -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f h264 -y out_360p30.264 -map '[d]' -r 30 -b:v 625K -max-bitrate 625K -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f h264 -y out_160p30.264
